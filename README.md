# 🎨 Dribbble Website Clone  

Welcome to my second project from Sheryians! 🚀 In this project, I've recreated the iconic Dribbble website using HTML and CSS.                    
As a frontend enthusiast, I found immense joy in replicating the design and functionality of one of the leading design platforms. Through problem-solving and exploration, I honed my skills while thoroughly enjoying the process.
